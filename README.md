Implements for Unity in fields of IoC, Reactive programming, Firebase, Photon Server, etc.

Universal Resolver is an IoC Framework, which is a combination of binding settings as scriptableobject, along with C# Attributes which allow you to resolve any fields, constructors, methods or properties as [Component], [Singleton], [Prefab] or [Transient]. 

There are a lot of test scenes in the sample folder. Also I developed a minesweeper game using this framework, inside the sampleGame folder.

This asset supports

- Resolve both C# & Unity Component objects.
- Build games on Editor, Standalone, iOS, Android and WebGL.
- Write loose-couple and testable C# code.
- Using scriptable setting files to do binding, it means you don't need to change the code to change the behavior
- You just need to change setting files and run or restart your game to have changes applied.
